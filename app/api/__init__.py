"""
Nexus API Package

This package contains all API routes and endpoints for the Nexus application.
Routes are organized by version (v1, v2, etc.) to maintain backward compatibility
when making breaking changes.

Current versions:
- v1: Initial API version

Note: Routes are currently imported individually in main.py rather than using the api_router.
